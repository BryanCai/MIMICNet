# DeepComputationalPhenotyping
Cleaned Deep Learning Code for DeepComputationalPhenotyping

In order to run the code, you need to install these python packages: theano, pandas, scikit-learn, and ipython notebook.

This is the demo codes which have all the necessary functions and provide some basic results.

notebooks/DemoNewSdATrainingOnMedical1.ipynb is an example of the running pipeline. You can run each cell from top to bottom to test the code. You may need to pre-process your data to fit the similar format. It will call corresponding functions from different files for data loading, network training, and evaluation.

tengwar\nnet\NewSdA.py is the main part of our prior-based neural network training code. Once you're familiar with the general running pipeline, you can call functions in this file directly for specific tasks.
